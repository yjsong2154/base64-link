    <h1>Chrome Extension for base64 link</h1>
</div>

This repository contains a minimal Chrome/Chromium extension that uses the newest version of the manifest (v3).

You can use it as a basis to develop an extension.
It can also give you more insights about how to turn a v2 extension to v3.


## Installation
- **Open [the extensions page](chrome://extensions)** in your browser: `chrome://extensions`. This link works on any chromium-based browser.
- If you did not do it already, **toggle the "developer mode"**. This is usually a toggle button at the top right of the extensions page.
- Click the button **_load unpacked extension_**.
- In the window that pops up, **select the folder that contains this minimal extension**, then **click _ok_**.
- **Done!** A new extension called _Chrome Addon v3 Starter_ should have appeared in the list.
